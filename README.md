## ⏳ How It's Made: 

**Tech Used: JavaScript, Node, Express, React, Mongoose, MongoDB, Passport, CSS

The application is built using the MERN stack. The front end is assembled with the React library, while Node.js and Express construct the back end following an MVC architecture. MongoDB serves as the database for user and task storage, and Passport.js is employed for user authentication.


## 💡 Optimization: 

Database indexing to optimize MongoDB queries and enhance performance.
Apply client-side caching for static assets to reduce the number of requests and improve load times.
More detailed error handling on both the front and back end to provide informative feedback and simplify debugging.


## 📝 Lessons Learned: 

Understanding and implementing efficient state management using context and hooks to oversee user authentication and authorization.
Utilizing useEffect to manage side effects, handle component life cycle events, and prevent memory leaks by cleaning up resources.
Learning to effectively use React Router for directing client-side navigation, implementing features like nested routes, and managing route guards for secure navigation.
